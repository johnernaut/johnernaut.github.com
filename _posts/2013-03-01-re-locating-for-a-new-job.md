title: Re-locating for a new job

I was recently hired by a company whom had an office in Austin, TX - approximately 300 miles from where I was living at the time in Houston.  One of the requirements that I agreed to upon being hired was relocating my family within a "reasonable" time-frame.

## Getting shit done on the home-front

Being a home-owner I had a couple of decisions to think about regarding my home before I could even begin to start the packing process.  First of all, what was I going to do with my house?  Is it better to rent it out or try and sell it off?  The first thing that came into my mind was "sell the damned thing and be done with it - start fresh."  However, due to the current market and location of my home - selling it wasn't going to be easy without risking the possibility of the house staying empty for (x) amount of months while I'm paying rent living in another city.

This left me with the more reasonable choice for my particular situation: renting my home out.  Luckily I'm familiar with the home-rental business.  I have family members who've been leasing out homes as a living for years.  That being said, I dreaded the situation that I was in.  Leasing out your home puts you in an awkward spot when your tenants decide to go haywire.  Evictions, court costs, excessive damage to your property: these were all things that terrified me.  I was advised by a close friend that the best thing to do in my case would be to go with a management company who would take care of all of those problems for me as they came up, which is what I decided to do.

## A month away from move time

Many companies offer their employees a relocation package that entitles them to use a certain amount of money fort thir move.  Some companies while give you that amount upfront, whereas others will require you to file all costs as an expense after the fact (which was my case).  If you fall into the first category - lucky you.  

No matter what your situation is you're going to want to look into the pro's and cons of hiring a moving company versus renting a truck and doing it yourself.  In my case, hiring a moving company would have cost me close to $2,000 excluding their packing service.  If I were to have rented a truck, the total would have come out to $200 plus the cost of gas.  Like I said, if you're company gives you your relocation package up-front, renting a truck may save you a ton of money and let you pocket the extra (depending on the distance of your move).

Packing *sucks*.  *A lot*.  If I could do it over again I would have started the packing process much sooner than a month before my move date.  You really don't realize the amount of crap that you end up collecting during the duration of stay at your current place of residance.  That being said, *start packing now*.

## Two weeks until move time

At this point I was feeling the pressure.  It seemed like we'd been packing for a month and we hadn't even made a dent yet.  Some key things that I needed to make sure of were settling contracts and fee's with the management company, settling contracts and fee's for the new rental home we were moving into and *changing all of our account informations' addresses to the new address we were moving to* (as well as forwarding all mail from our local post office).

The moving company expected everything to be packed and ready to go for when they arrived.  They even had strict rules on how certain items were to be packed, otherwise they wouldn't load it onto the truck do to liability reasons.  One thing that helped us out a lot was saving money on boxes.  Boxes are *rediculously* expensive for what they essentially are.  Most boxes that I came across were around $4 each for a medium size.  You can probably expect $5 - $6 for larger boxes.  Each.  What I ended up doing is going by my local grocery stores in the evening.  You'd be amazed how many free boxes you can salvage from those places.

## Generality

When moving, especially if you have children old enough to be in school, I'd recommend renting for a short lease (6 months or so) until you get acclimated to the area.  Sure you may have friends or family that have told you the area you're looking at moving into is a nice one, but what about *your* area.  You may realize after a few weeks that your neighbor likes to have late-night parties 3 days a week.  You may find out that the schools really aren't what they were cracked up to be.  Figuring some of these things out in your new city will take time - don't make long term commitments right off the starting line.

All in all the move was successful.  There's still a lot of things that need to be taken care of.  My house is listed and is currently being shown to prospective tenants, but there's still that nervous itch that I have waiting to hear the "good news" about someone wanting to move in so I don't have to worry about covering my mortgage there any more.
